      "sixty minutes rewind captain hopper is a whiz at mathematics some would say a genius one of that small band of brothers and sisters who ushered in the computer revolution in World War two at age 37 she left her professor's job at Vassar to serve as a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve she was sent to Harvard to help program the very first computer it had the unglamorous name of mark 1 and as far as we've progressed since this vacuum tube monster captain hopper says we ain't seen nothing yet you talk a lot about the computer revolution I thought we're in it and it's over no we're only at the beginning we've been through the preliminaries well what's it gonna be well we've got the Model T just the Model T that's where we are now she's up many mornings before 5:00 for the ride to Washington's National Airport 200 days a year she lectures two computer scientists at military bases she's also in demand on college campuses and among businessmen the Navy's proud to show off one of theirs who was in at the beginning she is more than just a superb mathematical talent it was Grace Hopper who helped teach the machines a language stopped them from speaking and undecipherable numbers enabled them to speak in English or French or German or whatever language you choose the first computer Grace Hopper worked on could do three calculations a second today's computers can do thousands a second millions a second sped along by tiny silicon chips educated grains of sand and billions and trillions of calculations a second are not too far off how do you explain that kind of speed they started talking about circuits that acted in nanoseconds billionths of a second I didn't know what a billion was I don't think most of those men downtown know what a billion is either and if you don't know what a billion is how on earth you know what a billionth is I fussed in fumed finally one morning in total desperation I called over to the engineering building and I said please cut off a nanosecond and send it over to me and I brought you some today now what I wanted when I asked for a nanosecond was I wanted a piece of work which would represent the maximum distance that electricity could travel in a billionth of a second now of course it wouldn't really be through wire be out in space the velocity of light so if we start with a velocity of light and use your friendly computer you'll discover that a nanosecond is 11.8 inches long the maximum limiting distance that electricity can travel in a billionth of a second finally the end of about a week I called back and said I need something to compare this to could I please have a microsecond I've only got one microsecond so I can't give you each one here's a microsecond 984 feet race hopper is at the center of a revolution that is changing life as we know it it tells the Navy how many tons of baked beans it has on hand it targets its missiles a revolution that can free human hands and the console at least on paper human problems in seconds where it used to take years at 76 she is in the chain of command that runs from the commander in chief to the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Navy across to the lone woman whose picture is the only one in black and white because she's still looking for a good color photo of herself if you got into private industry probably a very rich person I've already received the highest award I'll ever receive no matter how long I live no matter how many more jobs that may have and that has been the privilege and the responsibility of serving very proudly in the United States Navy regret it was the Navy not the army or the Air Force well it had to be the Navy because my great-grandfather was a Rear Admiral besides which I like blue\n"

She believes that the computer revolution is only in its beginning stages and that there is much more progress to be made. Hopper is highly respected in the field and is sought after for lectures and presentations. She is known for teaching computers to understand human language and for her work on increasing computational speed.
